# Mdb

App for viewing information about movies, tv shows, actors, actresses and more! Like IMDB, but with less clutter. This is a work in progress and some modules are not finished or fully polished. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Make sure you have the latest versions of node and npm installed. Run 'npm install' to download packages before running app.
